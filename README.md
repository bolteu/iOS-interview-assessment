# Assessment

## Task

In the project, you can find `cities.json`. You have to:

- parse this file
- add markers of these cities to the map

Sample functions how to deal with it already exist in the code below.

## Notes

What should be taken into account:

- You can use any tools and any libraries (even Google)
- You can use any architecture
- You can use Swift
- Your solution should support later replacement local JSON with network results

## Main criteria

- It works
- Architecture
- Scalability
- Readability

**PS:** Despite the task looks very simple, the final solution should be created for long-term support, and it should be well-extensible.
